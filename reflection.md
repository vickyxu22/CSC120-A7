- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For cafe, I overload the name of the customer who is buying the coffee in the `sellCoffee()`. This was inspired by Starbucks, for which it always has the name of the customer on it's cup.
I also overload the day of the week when restocking occurs in `restock()`, because raw material's expiration date is very important.

For house, I overload the occupation of the new resident in the `moveIn()` as well as the age of the new resident in the `moveOut()`. These information may let our new resident make friends sooner in the neighborhood. 

For library, I overload the name of the borrower in `checkOut()`. Otherwise, it's hard for library to track the book. 
I overload the author of the added book in `addTitle()` as well, which gives us more information about the added book.

I think everything works well. The suggestion for future course takers would still be start the project EARLY!
